# What is Deepwoken TTRPG?

Deepwoken TTRPG (Tabletop Role-playing Game) is a tabletop role-playing game with systems and content based around the world of [Deepwoken](https://www.roblox.com/games/4111023553/Deepwoken-Verse-2), a permadeath RPG on Roblox.

I decided to create this RPG because I thought that Deepwoken's existing systems would already map well to an interesting TTRPG and that the setting would make for great roleplaying.

## What is Deepwoken? (For TTRPG fans)
Deepwoken is an open-world permadeath RPG on Roblox, set in a world called Lumen where several factions fight over control of the "Luminants". The unique feature of the world is that when you die, you sink down to The Depths, an underwater chamber composed of multiple layers and vicious monsters. Death in The Depths is permanent and sends you to the Fragments of Self to create a new character and start again. The game is highly focused on tight, fast-paced combat and cruel player interaction.
