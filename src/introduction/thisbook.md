# Reading This Book

This book serves as both a rulebook and a handbook. The first section after this one is "How to Play" which covers creating your character and playing through a campaign. Everything after that is rules.

As said in [About](./about.md), *"Deepwoken RPG" refers to this tabletop role-playing game, while just "Deepwoken" refers to the Roblox Game.*

This is to simplify referencing this game within its own rules. The rules may also frequently refer it to as simply "the game" or "this RPG". I'm not sure how to turn this game's name into an acronym, so this will do for now.
