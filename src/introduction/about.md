# About

Deepwoken RPG (Tabletop Role-playing Game) is a tabletop role-playing game with systems and content based around the world of [Deepwoken](https://www.roblox.com/games/4111023553/Deepwoken-Verse-2), a permadeath RPG on Roblox.

*"Deepwoken RPG" refers to this tabletop role-playing game, while just "Deepwoken" refers to the Roblox Game.*

Deepwoken RPG (as well as Deepwoken) is set in a fantasy world where civilization is declining and the major factions of the world are at conflict. Adventurers, known as Pathfinders, scower the harsh world for wealth and power, travelling by ship over a large sea of continents (known as 'Luminants') to further their conquest. Thus, this RPG's gameplay is focused on the cruel, survivalistic journeys from place to place. Like Deepwoken and different from most tabletop RPGs, it tries to minimize randomness in the case of combat. It also has no classes, as Deepwoken has a cool and complex build system that this RPG tries to replicate.
